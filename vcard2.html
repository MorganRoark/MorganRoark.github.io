			<h1>Morgan Roark</h1>
			<h2>Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
			
			<p>I am currently a senior, Cross-Cultural Service major with a Photography minor at Bob Jones University in Greenville, Sc. In addition to being a full time student, this is also my fourth year working at the Pennington Child Development Center with a class of two year olds. </p>
			<p>
				This past summer I completed a two-month, Cross-Cultural Service internship in Grantsville, Utah, through Bob Jones University. This internship gave me experience with organizing a children's Vacation Bible School, teaching, and interacting with people of all ages. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some things I enjoy doing for fun include: photography, vegetable gardening, hiking, and spending time with friends and family.
